// There is a convention that all the variables in JavaScript are written in "camel case". Here is an example:
const firstNamePerson = "John"; // camel case style
const first_name_person = "John"; // this style is more used in Python
// Variables can't start with a number.
// They only admit letters, numbers and the dollar sign.
// Variables that won't change, we usually write them in caps lock and with the reserved word "const".

// Other form to declare a varible it's with the reserved word "let".
let lastName = "Smith";
// Normally, the "let" variables will change in the future. "const" are with a fixed value.

// The seven primitive data types are:
let age = 27;           // 1) Number (integer and floats)
const name = "John";    // 2) Strings
let running = false;    // 3) Boolean (true or false)
let nope;               // 4) Undefined (declare a variable without a value)
// The next ones are rarely used. It's only for very especific tasks.
// 5) Null (also means empty value)
// 6) Symbol
// 7) BigInt
